This new release's main addition is a tool called <a href="http://www.freecast.org/broadcast">FreeCast Manager</a>, which offers you to start a network stream in one single mouse click. Every needed components (including a very small HTTP server) are included in the same single graphical application. Everything is set up automatically at start up. From the orign, one of the main goal of this project is to provide the user with one of the simplest streaming experience. The listener client application starts with a single mouse click, updates itself automatically, requires no configuration from the final user, includes an embedded Ogg player capable of playing sound as well as video, and it can be set to the broadcaster's colors.
