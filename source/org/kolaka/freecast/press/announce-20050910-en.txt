FreeCast : after "Click & Listen", discover "Click & Broadcast"

After this summer's festivals, the FreeCast team went back to work and offers you this new version today.

FreeCast is a peer-to-peer streaming solution based on Ogg encoding format. Audio (Ogg/Vorbis) or video (Ogg/Theora) streaming content are thus allowed.

This new release's main addition is a tool called "FreeCast Manager", which offers you to start a network stream in one single mouse click. Every needed components (including a very small HTTP server) are included in the same single graphical application. Everything is set up automatically at start up.

One of the main goal of this project is to provide the user with one of the simplest streaming experience. The client application starts with a single mouse click, updates itself automatically, requires no configuration from the final user, includes an embedded Ogg player capable of playing sound as well as video, and it can be set to the broadcaster's colors.

The project first initiated in 2004 aimed at fulfilling the needs of transitory radios stations. Since the beginning, the development team worked hand in hand with final users and broadcasters. Documentation and support are particularly attended to, because broadcasting on the Internet implies quite some skills a potential broadcaster may not have. //, no matter what. //

The whole project is distributed under GPL license.

Thanks to a Debian package, you can build your own network in a few minutes. RPM packages are awaiting contributors! And Windows users will find a dedicated installer.
