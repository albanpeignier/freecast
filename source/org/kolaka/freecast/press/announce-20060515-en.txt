FreeCast 20060515

After a busy winter, the FreeCast team is proud to publish this new major release.

FreeCast is now two years old, and the experience we gained through its dev led us to a deep rewriting of 
the protocol, and the transport layer was switched from TCP to UDP. We also added the long-awaited NAT trav.
The FreeCast networks won't be stopped anymore by misconfigured NATs.

FreeCast Manager has been thoroughly reviewed by our user community, and we added some new features, 
such as the ability of broadcasting a playlist/list of files thanks to an integrated Ogg Vorbis encoder.
To ease the use of FreeCast, one simple dialog allows you to setup your broadcast.
With FreeCast's "Click & Broadcast", broadcasting your own content has never been so easy.

Short changelog:

UDP transport layer, NAT traversal, STUN reference, Latency analysis, Embedded Ogg encoder, 
FreeCast Manager Setup GUI, Improved Windows installer

Complete changelog:

- UDP transport layer

Connections between nodes are now performed via UDP connections. Network problems are overcomed more easily. Note that socket receivers are replaced by UDP receivers. The new transport layer uses the Apache Mina API (http://directory.apache.org/subprojects/mina/).

- NAT traversal

Two nodes can open a connection even if they are both behind a NAT (routeur or equivalent equipment). This new feature allows larger FreeCast networks and removes the manual forward configuration requirement.

- STUN reference

Node can perform STUN requests to determinate its public address. Required for NAT traversal. Use Jstun API (http://jstun.javawi.de/).

- Latency analysis

The FreeCast protocol includes messages used to estimate the network latency between nodes. A node opens connections to several other nodes and uses the connection with the lower latency.

- Embedded Ogg encoder

To make simplier FreeCast Manager and root node deployement, the new playlist encoder receiver can create the Vorbis Ogg stream from a given playlist of wav, ogg or mp3 files. Thus, the FreeCast root node can broadcast a playlist without the need of a third application. This feature requires the use of native libraries and is available for the moment under Linux x86 and Windows platforms (Mac OS contributors are welcome). Based on tritonus libvorbis binding (http://tritonus.org/).

- FreeCast Manager Setup GUI

A new "Configure FreeCast" menu appears in FreeCast Manager. This setup dialog allows for the moment the configuration of the root node receiver. You can switch from the default demo content to your own playlist (via the embedded ogg encoder), or receive the Ogg stream from a third party application.

- Improved Windows installer

With the help of numerous windows users feedback, the Windows installer has been improved. Shortcuts have been added to make easier user configuration. FreeCast startup scripts have been improved to fix several issues.
